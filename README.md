## Overview

The Student Internship Documentation Manager is a web application designed to manage and organize documentation related to on-the-job training or internships of students in both middle-grade and higher-degree training cycles. It provides an intuitive platform for institutions, students, and companies to track and handle all necessary documents and interactions for a seamless internship experience.

This project is not only an efficient solution for managing internship documentation but also serves as a demonstration of practical applications using various modern technologies.

ðŸš§ Project Status: The development of this application is currently under construction. Many features are still in progress, and the application may not be fully functional at the moment.
Key Features

- Student Profiles: Store and manage information about each student, their assigned company, and their internship progress. (In Progress)
- Document Management: Upload, categorize, and track various internship-related documents. (Planned)
- User Authentication: Secure login and user management system. (In Progress)
- Intuitive UI: A user-friendly interface built with React.js that allows easy navigation and efficient task completion.

## Technologies Used

- Backend: The server-side logic is built using Golang, offering a robust and efficient backend structure.
- Frontend: The user interface is developed using React.js, providing a reactive and modern UI.
- Containerization: Docker and Docker Compose are employed for easy development, deployment, and scalability.

## Motivation

This project was initiated as a hands-on exercise to practice and showcase skills in Golang, React.js, Docker, and other related technologies. While it serves a practical purpose in managing student internships, the primary goal is to experiment with and understand the underlying tech stack.
